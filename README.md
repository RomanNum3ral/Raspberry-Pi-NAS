Script to fast-track installation of Raspeberry Pi NAS

Install Open Media Vault script first then Plex Media Server if you wish to use it as a media server. 

you may have to change the user "pi" in open_media_vault_only to include the correct path:
echo "python /home/pi/x735-v2.5/pwm_fan_control.py&" >> ~/.bashrc

change "pi" to your username to automate fan startup in .bashrc

Enjoy :)
